## Natural Language Processing Knowledge Graph Extension

This repository includes a dataset of knowledge graph triples extracted from news articles. 
The dataset (available in 'news_knowledge_graph_triples.csv') was created as part of PortNLP's research in knowledge graphs.

Each row consists of:
- **Sentence** — the original sentence from the source article
- **Triple** — a subject–relation–object representation derived from the sentence
- **Source** — the originating news publication

Triples are constrained to entities of type **Person**, **Organization**, and **Location**.
